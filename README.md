# Obsidian Zotero Importer

This script automatically converts entries from a Zotero `.bib` export (via Better BibTeX) into Obsidian-ready Markdown notes. It is designed for use with a structured note-taking system in which each bibliographic reference is stored as a literature note (`LN`) with standardized filenames and YAML frontmatter.

---

## üîß Setup

### 1. Configure Zotero with Better BibTeX
- In Zotero, right-click your **Library** or a **Collection**
- Choose `Export Library...` or `Export Collection...`
- Format: **Better BibTeX**
- ‚úÖ Check `Keep updated`
- Output file path: `/home/dan/zoterobib/bibliography.bib`

> üìÅ This file is continuously maintained by Zotero on the local system `Wealtheow`.

### 2. Project Structure
```
~/zoterobib/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bibliography.bib   # auto-updating BibTeX export from Zotero

~/wealtheow/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ LN Literature Notes/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ LN LastName YYYY Short Title.md  # Generated Markdown notes
```

### 3. Run the Script
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install bibtexparser python-slugify
```

Run:
```bash
python zotero_obsidian_sync.py
```

Each BibTeX entry is converted into a note with:
- YAML frontmatter (including `citekey` and `type`)
- Chicago-style citation
- Abstract
- Keywords (as Obsidian `[[wikilinks]]`)
- A preserved notes block for personal commentary

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Sync Strategy
This project assumes that:
- Zotero + `.bib` export + Markdown generation is managed **only on Wealtheow**
- Obsidian Sync (or another sync system) distributes the resulting `.md` files to other machines
- Only this machine runs the sync script

---

## üìÑ Example Output File
```
LN Haraway 1985 Cyborg Manifesto.md
```
```markdown
---
citekey: "haraway1985cyborg"
type: "article"
